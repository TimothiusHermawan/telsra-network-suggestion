# Telsra Network Suggestion

## Background

This project is a challenge from Telsra on kaggle. Background of the challenge is as following:

"Telstra is on a journey to enhance the customer experience - ensuring everyone in the company is putting customers first. In terms of its expansive network, this means continuously advancing how it predicts the scope and timing of service disruptions. Telstra wants to see how you would help it drive customer advocacy by developing a more advanced predictive model for service disruptions and to help it better serve its customers."

Therefore we tried to simulate the prediction of network disruption by using machine learning. In the end, we merge the data with longitute and latitude of base station in australia and visualize it into map.
